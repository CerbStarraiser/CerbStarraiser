- 👋 Hi, I’m @CerbStarraiser
- 👀 I’m interested in eventually learning how to code again.  I did VB6 back in the day, so I'm crazy with Office and VBA... but I'm going to start going to school in March 2022 for my IST degree and will be learning REAL coding again soon.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get re-enrolled in school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet--I'm still working my way up.
- 📫 How to reach me ...  Um, I don't do social media--gave that up years ago.  I'm not sure you're supposed to put your email on these?  So lemme figure out how Github works and I'll get back to you.
