- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CerbStarraiser
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all kinds of code.  I did VB6 back in the day, so I'm crazy with Office and VBA... I am doing a lot of HTML, JavaScript and PHP for various custom systems for work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to set up new internal systems using Windows Server, MS SQL, IIS, and PHP.
- I'm recently went back to school for my IT degree. I'm just about done. When I wrap up school, I want to start learning how to code my own gaming addons.
